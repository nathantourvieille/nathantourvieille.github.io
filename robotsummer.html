      Over the span of six weeks, I designed and built two autonomous robots capable of playing a real-life version of the game Overcooked along with my 3 groupmates. The objective of the competition was to score as many points as possible in two minutes by assembling food items, such as burgers, salads, and fries, each worth varying points, and delivering them to a serving area marked by a 1 kHz IR beacon. Our strategy focused on just making burgers as fast as possible.
The robots worked in tandem, each performing a specialized role to streamline the process.
•	Robot 1 (Ingredient Picker): Positioned in the upper region of the competition surface, this robot was responsible for navigating to ingredient areas and picking up individual ingredients. It then transported and placed these ingredients onto either the cooking or cutting surface for the second robot to retrieve.
•	Robot 2 (Burger Assembler): This robot collected the ingredients from the cooking or cutting surface, stacking them vertically in a specially designed chute to assemble burgers efficiently. The chute was engineered to align the ingredients precisely, ensuring consistent burger construction. Once the stack was complete, the robot picked up a plate and dispensed the assembled burger onto the plate, at the serving area.
Come competition day, we were able to assemble two burgers in two minutes consistently. Unfortunately, in the semi-finals we had a malfunction and ended up in 4th place.
